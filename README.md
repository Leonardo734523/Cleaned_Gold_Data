Description

This dataset contains daily gold market data for the last five years, sourced from Yahoo Finance using the ticker GC=F.

It is designed specifically for time-series forecasting tasks, where the objective is to model and predict future gold prices using historical trends and technical indicators.

The dataset includes traditional OHLCV market data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) along with commonly used technical analysis indicators such as moving averages, volatility measures, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.

This makes it suitable for: • Financial time-series forecasting • Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) • Statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) • Prophet forecasting • Feature engineering and EDA ⸻
